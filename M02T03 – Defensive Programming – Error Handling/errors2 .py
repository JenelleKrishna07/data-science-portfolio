# Fixed and commented version of errors2.py

# Syntax Error: missing quotes around string
animal = "Lion"  # Fixed syntax: added quotes

animal_type = "cub"
number_of_teeth = 16

# Logical Error: incorrect sentence formatting
full_spec = f"This is a {animal}. It is a {animal_type} and it has {number_of_teeth} teeth"  # Fixed using f-string

print(full_spec)  # Fixed syntax: added parentheses
