# Data Science Portfolio

This repository presents a curated selection of data science projects demonstrating applied skills in Python, data analysis, and machine learning.

The work showcased here was completed as part of the Stellenbosch University Data Science Bootcamp and expanded through independent analytical exploration. Each project focuses on practical problem-solving, clean analytical thinking, and reproducible methodology rather than academic theory alone.

## Core Competencies Demonstrated

- Python for data analysis and modelling
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualisation
- Statistical reasoning and feature engineering
- Supervised and unsupervised machine learning
- Model evaluation and interpretation
- Clear communication of analytical insights

## Project Structure

Projects are organised into the following sections:

- **Python Foundations**  
  Core Python programming, data structures, and problem-solving exercises.

- **Data Analysis & Exploration**  
  Real-world datasets analysed using pandas, NumPy, and visualisation libraries, with emphasis on insight generation.

- **Machine Learning**  
  End-to-end modelling workflows including preprocessing, training, evaluation, and interpretation.

Each project folder contains a short project overview, the relevant code or notebooks, and supporting assets where applicable.
